## About
This project was a ending module project, where we used Angular Routing to build an aplication. Also we needed to make a API integration for all note posting and login/singup process.

It was a group project and i'm very proud of our effort to make it happen :)
Thanks a lot @MatAmaro, @luizacampello, @carvalhosmari and @MarcusFabI0 for this project!
